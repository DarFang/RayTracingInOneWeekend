# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

## About This Project

This repository contains my implementation of the **Ray Tracing in One Weekend** tutorial by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch. This is my journey into learning computer graphics programming through ray tracing.

## What is Ray Tracing?

Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating realistic images by simulating the way light interacts with objects in a scene. Unlike traditional rasterization, ray tracing traces the path of light rays as they bounce off surfaces, creating more realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections.

## Learning Goals

- **Graphics Programming Fundamentals**: Understanding the mathematical and programming concepts behind 3D graphics
- **Ray Tracing Implementation**: Building a complete ray tracer from scratch in C++
- **Computer Graphics Concepts**: Learning about vectors, materials, lighting, and rendering algorithms
- **C++ Programming**: Improving C++ skills through practical graphics programming

## Project Structure

This project follows the structure outlined in the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book:

- **Simple Ray Tracer**: Basic ray-sphere intersection
- **Materials**: Implementing different surface materials (diffuse, metal, dielectric)
- **Camera**: Perspective camera with adjustable field of view
- **Scene Building**: Creating complex scenes with multiple objects
- **Indirect Lighting**: Global illumination and soft shadows

## Development Environment

- **Compiler**: GCC 13.1.0 (MSYS2)
- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: Windows 10
- **IDE**: Cursor (with AI assistance)

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (GCC is recommended)
2. Follow along with the book chapters
3. Build and run the ray tracer
4. Generate beautiful rendered images

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, I will have:

- A working ray tracer that produces photorealistic images
- Deep understanding of computer graphics fundamentals
- Practical experience with C++ programming
- Foundation for more advanced graphics programming
